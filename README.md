# Inception-of-Things
This project is divided into three parts, each focusing on different aspects of Kubernetes using K3s and K3d in conjunction with Vagrant 

#### The primary goals of each part are as follows:
## Part 1: K3s and Vagrant:
- Set up two virtual machines using Vagrant and a preferred Linux distribution.
- Install and configure K3s on two machines: one machine will serve as the controller plane (server), and the other machine will act as the worker node.
## Part 2: K3s and Three Simple Applications:
- Deploy three simple applications into the Kubernetes cluster.
- Explore K3s Ingress capabilities to enable external access to the deployed applications.
## Part 3: K3d and Argo CD:
- Create a local Kubernetes cluster using K3d.
- Set up Argo CD, a continuous delivery tool, in the K3d cluster.

# Conclusion
 this project provides practical experience with Kubernetes, K3s, and K3d in a Vagrant environment. By setting up a functional Kubernetes cluster, participants gain valuable insights into lightweight Kubernetes with K3s, cluster management, Ingress, application deployment, and Argo CD for GitOps. These acquired skills enhance the ability to deploy and manage containerized applications effectively in various Kubernetes setups.
